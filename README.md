# Buzzer

Buzzer is an application for Android that vibrates your phone at set
times. This helps you to effortlessly keep track of the time. Buzzer
acts like a modern replacement of a standing or cuckoo's clock, it's
customizable and it only affects you.

## Features

* Choose at what time you would like your phone to vibrate
* Choose between multiple vibration patterns, so won't confuse Buzzer
with normal notifications
* Configure times at which Buzzer should be silent, so you won't be
annoyed at night
